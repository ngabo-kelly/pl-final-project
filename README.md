# Hospital Management System – Business Process Modeling

## 📌 Objective

This project presents a **Business Process Model** for a **Hospital Management System (HMS)** using BPMN. The model demonstrates how Management Information Systems (MIS) are used to support hospital workflows, from patient registration to discharge. It aims to improve operational efficiency, centralize information, and support real-time decision-making.

## 🗂️ Scope

The modeled process covers key hospital operations:

- Patient Registration
- Diagnosis and Treatment
- Prescription Fulfillment
- Billing and Discharge

The process shows how data flows across hospital departments and how MIS ensures seamless integration and task automation.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Key Entities

- **Receptionist** – Registers new patients and initiates the workflow.
- **Doctor** – Performs diagnosis and issues prescriptions.
- **Pharmacy** – Provides prescribed medication.
- **Billing Department** – Handles invoicing and payments.
- **Patient Database** – Stores patient records, diagnoses, prescriptions, and billing info.
- **MIS System** – Facilitates coordination, automation, and centralized data access.

## 🧭 Process Overview (Using BPMN and Swimlanes)

- The process is modeled using **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**.
- **Swimlanes** are used to separate roles/departments, clarifying responsibilities.
- Notation includes:
  - **Start/End Events**
  - **Tasks**
  - **Gateways** (for decisions)
  - **Data Objects** (forms, prescriptions, reports)

---

## 🔄 Logical Flow

1. Patient arrives at the hospital.
2. Receptionist registers the patient in the MIS.
3. Doctor accesses patient info, conducts diagnosis, and prescribes treatment.
4. Pharmacy receives prescription and provides medication.
5. Billing department prepares invoice and processes payment.
6. Patient is discharged after payment.

All interactions are managed through the MIS platform, ensuring up-to-date records and efficient processing.

## ✅ MIS Benefits

- **Improved Decision-Making**: Real-time access to patient and treatment data.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated workflows reduce delays and errors.
- **Centralized Data**: One system for all departments.
- **Process Transparency**: Clear roles and responsibilities improve collaboration.
